    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Birds Species Detection using VGG 16 Algorithm</b></li>
        <p>The Project proposes a robust deep learning BCC.h5 model by using VGG(Visual Geometry Group)-16 which is a deep convolution neural network for easily identifying bird species. By integrating bird data alongside species identification, users gain access to extensive insights into recognized avian species, enriching their comprehension of bird diversity and behaviors. Moreover, the incorporation of bird vocalizations introduces an immersive element to the project, enabling users to interact with the auditory facets of bird recognition</p>
        <li><b>Life Savers</b></li>
        <p>In this project, we developed a web application which helps people to donate and receive blood instantly. The people who are struggling with lack of blood they can easily contact with donors through this website.</p>
        <li><b>Farmer Services</b></li>
        <p>This project suggest farmers in their respective areas. Ex: Selling crops, lending tools etc..., The farmers can directly sell their crop to business people without any third party interaction through this website. They can get maximum profit. In addition to, another module included in this website useful for tenant farmers. Tenant farmers can easily get crop cultivation tools through this website.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Internships</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Web Development (Jan 2024- July 2024)| Numetry Technologies</b></li>
        <p>Through a combination of lectures, practical exercises and personal project I gained a well understanding of HTML,CSS, Java Script and how they are used to create engaging and interacting websites. Learned how to
           connect application with database.</p>
        <li><b>Machine Learning (May 2023- July 2023)|IBM Skill build (APSCHE)</b></li>
        <p>Learned how to load the data, preprocess the data, create a model through these combination of lectures. Learned different concepts in machine learning classification, clustering, regression, Decision tree problems etc...</p>
    </ul>
